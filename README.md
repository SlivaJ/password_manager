# password_manager
A password manager that can generate and store passwords. (I am not a security person, This is just a project for me to learn some new things.
(Please don't use this in its current state)

This is an electron GUI application that will generate and store passwords for you. The goal here is to show use of databases and learn about securing data. 
I think passoword managers are one of the most overlooked tools for the majority of people who are not technically inclined. As a one person team and having
no security experience I would like to learn more password managers and how they work so I figured the best way to do that was to try making one and see what happens.

TLDR:
This is a project for me to learn some new skills and techniques
It is likely not secure in some way so please dont rely on it
